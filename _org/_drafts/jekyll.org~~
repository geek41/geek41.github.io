** Working with drafts

  Drafts are posts without a date. They’re posts you’re still working on and don’t want to publish yet. To get up and running with drafts, create a _drafts folder in your site’s root (as described in the site structure section) and create your first draft:

|-- _drafts/
|   |-- a-draft-post.md
To preview your site with drafts, simply run jekyll serve or jekyll build with the --drafts switch. Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.
